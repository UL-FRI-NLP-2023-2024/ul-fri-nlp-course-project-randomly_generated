# Natural language processing course 2023/24: LLM Prompt Strategies for Commonsense-Reasoning Tasks

This repository contains code and resources accompanying the report on prompt strategies for commonsense reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). Common sense reasoning, vital for human intelligence, presents a challenge for LLMs. Our research delves into methodologies such as Chain of Thought (CoT), in-context learning, and plan-and-solve techniques to boost model performance in tasks requiring everyday knowledge.
