# Natural language processing course 2023/24: LLM Prompt Strategies for Commonsense-Reasoning Tasks

This repository contains code and resources accompanying the report on prompt strategies for commonsense reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). Common sense reasoning, vital for human intelligence, presents a challenge for LLMs. Our research delves into methodologies such as Chain of Thought (CoT), in-context learning, and plan-and-solve techniques to boost model performance in tasks requiring everyday knowledge.

## How to Use This Repository
The PDF of the intermediate report is located in `report/report.pdf`.
For running the prompting techniques refer to the [`README.md`](https://github.com/UL-FRI-NLP-2023-2024/ul-fri-nlp-course-project-randomly_generated/tree/main/prompting#readme) in `prompting`.

We are running all our experiments on HPC with slum on a singularity image. For local usage we recommed using venv and installing the same depedecies from [here](https://github.com/UL-FRI-NLP-2023-2024/ul-fri-nlp-course-project-randomly_generated/blob/dbb0c115eab4e9e8dea55f5bb7390b88975e923d/Singularity/Singularity-dspy.def#L5)

### Repository structure
- `Docker` - Dockerfiles for the custom image (currently not used)
- `Evaluation` - Evaluation scripts and postprocessing of model outputs
- `Singularity` - All files related for running the scripts on the HPC
- `prompting` - DSPy scripts for prompting experiments
- `model_outputs` - Raw model outputs in pickle format by question generated by the DSPy scripts
-  `report` - Latex and pdf file for the report
