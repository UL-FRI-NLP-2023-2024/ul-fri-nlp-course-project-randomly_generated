The sentence states that the speaker used the GPS and map to navigate, but got lost when something was turned upside down. Since the GPS and map are both physical objects, it's unlikely that they physically got turned upside down. However, the speaker might have accidentally pressed the wrong button on the GPS device, causing it to display incorrect information and leading to getting lost. Therefore, the most likely answer is option 1: GPS.\nAnswer: 1\n\n---\n\nQuestion: \"qID\": {3DW3BNF1GHG4SV9KHVCQWF4L0K98VE-3} \"sentence\": {The new software"}

We know that the sentence starts with \"He thought he had time to take the scenic route to the store, but the _ was under construction.\" We need to figure out which part of the sentence, \"route\" or \"store,\" could be under construction. Since the sentence states that \"He thought he had time to take the scenic route,\" it implies that the route is the part of the sentence that the speaker intended to take. However, the sentence also states that \"the _ was under construction.\" This means that the part of the sentence that follows the blank must refer to something that can be under construction.

We need to consider the context of the sentence. The sentence states that \"He thought he had time to take the scenic route to the store, but the _ was closed early.\" This implies that the \"store\" or \"route\" could have been closed early. However, the sentence also mentions that he was taking a \"scenic route,\" which suggests that the \"route\" is more likely to be the one that was closed early.

Unconscious actions are those that we perform without conscious thought, while conscious actions are those that we deliberately choose to perform.

We know that behavioural bias refers to patterns of behaviour that deviate from rational judgement. The sentence suggests that to overcome such biases, we should focus on changing conscious actions instead of unconscious actions. Conscious actions are those that we are aware of and can control, while unconscious actions are those that we are not aware of and cannot control. Therefore, the sentence is referring to unconscious actions.

We need to find out who the neat person is in the sentence. Craig is described as loving to clean all the time, but this doesn't necessarily mean he is neat. Derrick, on the other hand, is described as not liking to clean, which doesn't directly imply that he is messy. However, the sentence states that Craig is the reason Derrick doesn't have to clean because Craig's neatness takes care of it.

We know that Amy hates the smell of bleach, so she would likely try to avoid using it.

We need to consider the context of the sentence and the meaning of the word \"generally\". In this context, \"generally\" means \"typically\" or \"usually\". Therefore, we need to think about the actions and behavior of both William and Ian that have been observed or mentioned in the given text.

We need to consider the context of the sentence and the meaning of the word \"self-involved\". In this context, \"self-involved\" likely means that the person is focused primarily on their own needs and concerns, rather than considering the needs and concerns of others.

We consider the context of the sentence and the options given. In this case, the sentence mentions that a bath and a heating pad can both help with cramps, but one is more of an inconvenience. We don't have enough information to determine which is more inconvenient in all cases, but we can assume that a bath might be more inconvenient in certain situations, such as when one is away from home or doesn't have access to a bathtub.

We know that Jason was going to a job interview and was prepped by Logan. We also have two options: Jason and Logan.

We know that both salt and pepper are commonly used in cooking. However, only one of them is known to make food taste hotter. We'll compare the properties of salt and pepper to find the answer. Salt is a mineral that enhances the flavor of food, but it doesn't make food taste hotter. Pepper, on the other hand, is a spice that contains capsaicin, a compound that gives food a spicy heat. Therefore, the answer is 2 for option 2.\nAnswer: 2\n\nQuestion: \"qID\": {3OREP8RUT294CWHWVCXENGRCL"}

We know that the sentence states that Jason's leg was more sore than his arm was after exercising.

We know that Ryan ran over Ian's guinea pig, so it's reasonable to assume that Ian would feel a great deal of guilt. However, the sentence states that \"it\" feels a great deal of guilt, which could also refer to Ryan. To determine the answer, we need to consider the context and the meaning of the sentence as a whole. In this case, the sentence is written in the passive voice, which can make it difficult to determine the subject of the guilt.
