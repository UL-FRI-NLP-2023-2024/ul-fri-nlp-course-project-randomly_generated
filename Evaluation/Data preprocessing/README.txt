This script contains a class JsonlProcessor that is used to preprocess JSONL files. The class has several methods:

- convert_str_to_int(field): Converts the specified field from string to integer in all JSON objects in the file.

- rename_field(old_field, new_field): Renames a field in all JSON objects in the file.

- add_field_from_string(data_field, pattern, new_field): Adds a new field to all JSON objects in the file. The value of the new field is extracted from an existing field using a regular expression pattern.

- add_index_field(): Adds an 'index' field to all JSON objects in the file. The value of the index field is the line number of the JSON object in the file.
